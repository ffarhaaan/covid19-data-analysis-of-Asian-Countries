# Covid19-Data-Analysis-of-Asian-Countries
In this project we will import the datasets of Covid-19 infected rates and visualize the data to figure out which countries in the Asian Continent are more prone to getting affected. We will compare the Covid-19 affected data set with World Happiness Report of Asian countries provided by John Hopkins University to analyze the data.
I used python programming and different python modules like pandas,seaborn,matplotlib to anlalyze and visualize the data.
